[Leetcode-287] Find the Duplicate Number.

Given an array nums containing n+1 integers where each integer is between i and n(inclusive).

Prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the one.

Note:
1. You must not modify the array.
2. You must use only O(1) extra space.
3. Runtime complexity should be less than O(n^2).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
